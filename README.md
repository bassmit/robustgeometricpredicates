# Robust Geometric Predicates

A BURST compatible implementation of the [robust arithmetic and geometric predicates](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html) described by Jonathan Shewchuk. This package is a port of Govert van Drimmelen's [RobustGeometry.NET](https://github.com/govert/RobustGeometry.NET).

The master branch contains a Unity 2021.3.7 LTS project including unit tests.

### Installation
If [OpenUpm](https://openupm.com/) is not installed, ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed so you have access to npm and run:

    npm install -g openupm-cli

To add the package to a Unity project, open a prompt in the project root and run:

    openupm add com.bassmit.robustgeometricpredicates
